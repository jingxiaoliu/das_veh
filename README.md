### Description

![flowchart.](figures/flowchart.png)

This study proposes a novel method for detecting spatial subsurface heterogeneity and rain-induced soil saturation changes in the San Francisco Bay Area. Our approach utilizes vehicles as cost-effective surface-wave sources that excite wavefield recorded by a roadside Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) array. Leveraging a Kalman filter vehicle-tracking algorithm, we can automatically track hundreds of vehicles each day, allowing us to extract space-time windows of high-quality surface waves. By constructing highly accurate virtual shot gathers from these waves, we can perform time-lapse surface-wave analyses with high temporal and spatial resolutions.
